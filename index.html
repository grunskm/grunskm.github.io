			<h2>ABOUT</h2>

			In my work I'm interested in the aesthetic potential of computational systems, both on the computer screen and in physical media.
			My interest in this stems from my general lack of understanding of the digital technologies that have become so deeply embedded in our daily experience.
			Although my occupations as an artist are mainly material, I'm captivated by the immense potential that computational systems offer for visual exploration. 
			<br><br>
			Systems of spatial representation are of particular interest to me, including perspective, 3D modelling, and stereoscopy. 
			I'm also interested in the formal/conceptual gesture of asking a computer to complete a task, like drawing, that is so closely tied to ideas of subjective expression.
	
			<br><br>
			My main focus recently has been the building and programming computer controlled drawing machines, called pen plotters.
			Moving away from the LCD screen as the primary visual substrate of computation, I'm interested in the many alternative material possibilities that plotting opens for digitally generated art.
			Plotting also allows for some truely novel approaches to drawing/printmaking,that I've only just begun to explore, through enabling more direct engagment with conventional art materials like paper and ink.
			Through the manipulation of line, my plotter drawings approach topics like the generation of value, the depiction of perspectival space, and the simulation of human gesture.
			I build and program my plotters myself, giving me greater control over the specific relationships between my code and the finished drawings.
			<br><br>
			Before engaging directly with digital computation, my work centered around an exploration of composition that led me to use found images as compositions of large abstract paintings. 
			I've been working with the motif of 'random' dots since my BFA grad show in 2012 at NSCAD University.
			For me, the dots are stand-ins for subject matter while other formal and material aspects of the work become the focus.
			I've experimented with various ideas including colour, canvas structure, found composition, and most recently stereoscopy.
			Pre-dating my interest in computation, this body of work represents my earliest foray into systems-based artwork.
			<br><br>
			I am currently based out of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on Treaty One Territory where I teach drawing, painting and creative coding at the University of Manitoba,
			and maintain an independent artistic practice with support from the Canada Council for the Arts.I was previously based in Vancouver, BC, and am originally from Halifax, NS.
