		<h2>Stereo Decks
		</h2>

		<p>
		
		Stereo or "3D" images have been on the periphery of popular image culture since not long after the invention of the photograph, 
		reincarnated periodically in products like <i>Magic Eye</i> books, IMAX 3D movies, or the iconic <i>Viewmaster</i>. 
		The novelty of imbuing an image with the experience of spatial depth is captivating to many, but often fails to land with any 
		real impact, especially in relation to the world of 'fine art'. Few films can <i>only</i> be properly experienced in 3D, for example.  
		Nevertheless, for most sighted individuals, the perception of stereo depth is a constant feature of our lived experience and seems like
		a suitable vein to explore through the lens of artistic production. 
		</p><p>
		Recently, the VR headset has become a ubiquitous feature of the landscape of digital technology 
		and has been adopted as a tool by a wide range of new media artists. 
		As these devices become refined (although they're still pretty heavy), 
		the structure of the technology has become increasingly obscured. 
		With a <i>Viewmaster</i> one can remove the reel and inspect the individual cells.
		During an IMAX 3D film one can remove the glasses and see the double overlayed projection.
		A VR headset, by comparison, has fewer possibilities for the user to enter into the technology,
		posing a potential limitation to the development of creative discourse. 
		</p><p>
		The drawings featured on the stereo cards are generated directly using computer code and drawn using a modified vinyl cutter. 
<!-- 		Each form consists of a single wiggly line  -->
		Although there are a series of methods of viewing cards like these, including with a <i>stereoscope</i>, 
		the cards in these packs are intended to be experienced using the technique of <i><a href="../cross_eyed_free_view" style="text-decoration:underline;">cross-eyed free-viewing.</a></i>
