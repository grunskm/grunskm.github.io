				<h3>Handmade Plotter</h3>
				<p>
				With the intention of more deeply exploring the material aesthetics of computation, I recently
				designed, built and programmed my own drawing machine. 

				Rather than purchasing a ready-made plotter, I decided to take a shot at making one for myself
				to force myself to learn more about the underlying electronics, as well as escaping the 
				environment of the LCD monitor/ digital screen.  
				I believe having total control of a machine and being vulnerable to all of its flaws can enable a 
				more</p>
				<p>
				My plotter uses cartesian coordinate system for positioning the pen, with two discrete axes of 
				movement in a "flatbed" design. Contrary to some popular consumer plotters that combine the X,Y axes 
				into a "T" shape, the axes of my plotter are entirely independent of each other, simplify the construction and stability of the machine, 
				but also carries a conceptual representation of the how information is processed by the computer. 
				The X-axis of my plotter uses a recycled rail from a retired Epson printer and the Y-axis is formed 
				by a MDF panel fixed to two repurposed drawer slides. Both axes are articulated by NEMA stepper motors 
				and driven with an Arduino Uno.  
				</p>
				<p>
				While it would be possible to use a full-fledged computer (such as raspberry pi) to enable more complex 
				control of the plotter like printing vector files or responding to networked inputs, I chose
				to limit the plotter to only running scripts run directly by a microcontroller. This allows a 
				more direct feeling of drawing when working with the plotter and means each print must be expressed 
				algorithmically.
