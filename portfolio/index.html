<p class="description">
Between 2014 and 2019 I worked as a studio research assistant at the Studio For Extensive Aesthetics (SEA) at Emily Carr University of Art + Design.
The SEA is a Canada Research Council funded lab which focuses on the role of digital technology in contemporary visual culture and is directed by Canada Research Chair in Art and Design Technology and Associate Professor Amber Frid-Jimenez. 
The Studio has undertaken a variety of projects and installations in the Vancouver area and internationally. 
<br>
My role at the Studio evolved as I became increasingly exposed to the world of computational thinking. ...

		<p class="description"> 	
Salmon Run Wild is a single player side-scrolling game written in JavaScript using the p5.js creative coding library. 
Participants play as a spawning salmon, running upstream with the goal of fertilizing eggs. 
The game was developed for a 2018 BYOB event at VIVO media center in Vancouver BC and currently exists as an early-stage proof-of-concept. 
Several aspects of the gameplay and programming are still unfinished, and will continue to be developed in the future. 
<br>
<br>
At the time of its production Salmon Run Wild was the most advanced piece of programming I had undertaken, featuring multiple stage conditions, simulated physical forces, complex collision mechanics, and rudimentary game design. 
As a visual artist inexperienced with programming it was challenging to balance the development of many areas of the program simultaneously. 
In the end, however, this process proved to be incredibly valuable for my awareness of structure and efficiency within code.  
<br>
<br>
The core design of <i>Salmon Run Wild</i> originated from a frustration with the popular mobile game (now defunct) Flappy Bird. 
Based on the 2000 original <i>Helicopter Game</i>, <i>Flappy Bird</i> gained viral success in 2014, but lacks the playability of its precursor due to its unimaginative physics simulation. 
Both games use a single-button input to maneuver a flying object around obstacles, however, where <i>Helicopter Game</i> feels fast, dynamic, and dangerous, <i>Flappy Bird</i> feels slow and surprisingly brick-like. 
<i>Salmon Run Wild</i> is intended to recapture the joy that <i>Helicopter Game</i> succeeded in creating through inventive and subtle physical mechanics in single-button gameplay.
