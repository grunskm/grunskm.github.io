			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<p class="description">
					Between 2014 and 2019 I worked as a studio research assistant at the Studio For Extensive Aesthetics (SEA) at Emily Carr University of Art + Design.
					The SEA is a Canada Research Council funded lab which focuses on the role of digital technology in contemporary visual culture and is directed by Canada Research Chair in Art and Design Technology and Associate Professor Amber Frid-Jimenez. 
					The Studio has undertaken a variety of projects and installations in the Vancouver area and internationally. 
					<br>
					My role at the Studio evolved as I became increasingly exposed to the world of computational thinking. ...

			<h4 class="content-title">Painting Through the Screen</h4>
			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<div class="column">
					<p>
					Painting Through the Screen is a 6-credit 300 level studio course that I developed in collaboration with fellow painter M.E. Sparks. 
					The course is intended to address a gap in discourse between painting and computation that we perceived in our experience both as students and instructors. 
					We felt that there was a lack of criticality around the use of computers in undergraduate-level painting practice and sought to design a course that would draw connections between material and digital practices, while encouraging the development of digital literacy. 
					We currently co-teach Painting Through the Screen at NSCAD University in Halifax, NS. 
					<br><br>
					The curriculum for this class can be generally described using the following statements: 
					<ul> 
						<li>Looking at painting through the screen.<br><br>
						<li>Making paintings through screen-based tools.<br><br>
						<li>Considering painting as screen (or screen as painting).
					</ul>
					Following these three statements, students are exposed to certain fundamental elements of digital literacy in the context of a visual art studio course. 
					Students begin the class through exploring graphical user interfaces, the command-line, and the computerâ€™s file structure. 
					They then explore image file-formats and compression through producing glitches manually in a text-editor, before moving on to learning fundamentals of creative coding in JavaScript using p5.js. 
					<br><br>
					Throughout these lessons, students are encouraged to experiment with and explore the materials of the computer in the same way they would approach the physical materials of painting. 
					Many students have little or no prior knowledge of most of the topics that are covered in the class, but are assured that <b><i>not-knowing</i></b> can be a productive element of creative practice. 
					<br><br>
					After covering digital fundamentals, the course opens up to larger projects that give students the opportunity to design systems, approach topics, and apply their increased critical awareness of the screen as a tool, window, and object.

			<h4 class="content-title">Salmon Run Wild</h4>
			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<div class="description"> 	
					Salmon Run Wild is a single player side-scrolling game written in JavaScript using the p5.js creative coding library. 
					Participants play as a spawning salmon, running upstream with the goal of fertilizing eggs while avoiding predators. 
					The game was developed for a 2018 BYOB event at VIVO media center in Vancouver BC and currently exists as an early-stage proof-of-concept. 
					Several aspects of the gameplay, programming, and design are still unfinished, and will continue to be developed in the future.

					At the time of its production in 2018 Salmon Run Wild was the most advanced piece of programming I had undertaken, featuring multiple stage conditions, simulated physical forces, complex collision mechanics, and rudimentary game design. 
					As a visual artist inexperienced with programming it was challenging to balance the development of many areas of the program simultaneously. 
					In the end, however, this process proved to be incredibly valuable for my awareness of structure and efficiency within code.

				<div class="description"> 
					The core design of <i>Salmon Run Wild</i> originated from a frustration with the popular mobile game (now defunct) Flappy Bird. 
					Based on the 2000 original <i>Helicopter Game</i>, <i>Flappy Bird</i> gained viral success in 2014, but lacks the playability of its precursor due to its unimaginative physics simulation. 
					Both games use a single-button input to maneuver a flying object around obstacles, however, where <i>Helicopter Game</i> feels fast, dynamic, and dangerous, <i>Flappy Bird</i> feels slow and surprisingly brick-like. 
					<i>Salmon Run Wild</i> is intended to recapture the joy that <i>Helicopter Game</i> succeeded in creating through inventive and subtle physical mechanics in single-button gameplay.
