				<h3>Handmade Plotter</h3>
				<p>
  				With the intention of more deeply exploring the material aesthetics of computation, I recently
  				designed, built, and programmed my own drawing machine. Rather than purchasing a commercially available
          plotter, I decided to make one for myself, hoping that it would help me better understand
          the nuances of drawing with a computer and allow me to have more (or less) control over its output.
          I was also curious about exploring a material alternative to the ubiquitous LCD monitor which typically
          mediates our experience of computational processes.
        </p>
				<p id="long-text" style="display:none;">
  				My plotter uses the cartesian coordinate system for positioning the pen, with two discrete axes of
  				movement in a "flatbed" design. Contrary to some popular plotters that combine the X and Y axes
  				into a space saving "T" shape, the axes of my plotter are entirely independent of each other.
          This design simplifies the mecahnical construction of the machine and increases its stability considerably.
  				It also has a conceptual significance for the way it reflects the logic of computation.
          <br><br>
          In the current moment of CAD, rapid prototyping, and 3D printing, I feel it is important to acknowledge
          the beauty of the handmade when possible. Taking inspiration from the studio bricolage practice of Tom Sachs,
          I solved design problems with materials that I could find in my immediate environment.
          There are many recycled or repurposed objects including an old rail from a broken inkjet printer,
          salvaged drawer slides, and bits of scrap wood and wire from around my studio.
          <br><br>
          The plotter uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller as a brain, which controls one NEMA microstepper motor for each axis
          and a servo for raising and lowering the pen arm. Scripts are written in the Arduino IDE with a custom library of functions
          that I wrote specifically for this machine. There are certain limitations with this set-up in its current state, for instance it is
          not possible to print raster or vector files. All prints must be expressed through code and, while this is sometimes cumbersome,
          I find it allows a more direct feeling of drawing when working with the plotter.
