				<h3>Handmade Plotter</h3>
				<p>
  				With the intention of more deeply exploring the material aesthetics of computation, I recently
  				designed, built, and programmed my own drawing machine. Rather than purchasing a ready-made
          pen-plotter, I decided to make one for myself, hoping that it would help me better understand
          the relationship between a computer's virtual and physical elements. I was also interested
          in finding a material alternative to the ubiquitous LCD monitor which normally
          serves as our primary means of visual communication with the computer.
        </p>
				<p id="long-text" style="display:none;">
  				My plotter uses cartesian coordinate system for positioning the pen, with two discrete axes of
  				movement in a "flatbed" design. Contrary to some popular consumer plotters that combine the X,Y axes
  				into a space saving "T" shape, the axes of my plotter are entirely independent of each other.
          This design simplifies the mecahnical construction of the machine and increases its stability considerably,
  				but it also has a conceptual significance. Due to the way that the axes are entirely separated from each other, this machine
          does not mimic the gesture of the articulated human arm. This divergence from how we normally think of
          drawing, brings the internal processes of the computer to the surface.
          <br><br>
          There are many recycled or repurposed materials used in the construction of this machine.
          The X-axis uses an old rail from a broken Epson printer and the Y-axis consists
  				of an MDF panel fixed to two salvaged drawer slides. In the age of CAD, rapid prototyping, and 3D printing, it is
          important to me that tools retain their beauty. Taking inspiration from the studio bricolage practice
          of Tom Sachs, I aimed to use as many found, scavenged, or repurposed materials as possible in the design.
          <br><br>
  				While it would be possible to use a full-fledged computer to achieve more complex
  				control of the plotter (like printing vector files or responding to networked inputs) I chose
  				to limit the plotter with a comparitively basic microcontroller. As it is currently set-up
          scripts are written in the Arduino IDE with my custom plotter library and run directly on the machine with no screen preview.
          I find this allows a more direct feeling of drawing when working with the plotter and means each print must be expressed
  				entirely through code.
