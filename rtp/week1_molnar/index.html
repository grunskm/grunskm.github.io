    <p>
      This piece was a really interesting challenge to reproduce.
      The basic structure is a 12x12 grid with two square bracket
      shapes that are rotated/translated in what appears to be a
      random pattern and cropped by the underlying grid.
      <br><br>
      There are a few complications added to this idea, including the
      rotational symmetry around the central point of the canvas, and
      the independent rotation of each set of brackets.
      The amount of rotation for almost all brackets is within a narrow
      range that creates a specific negative shape between each pair.
      Occasionally there are outliers, but I had trouble finding the
      pattern that they follow.There are also a few instances where
      the shape is flipped so that it points in the opposite direction
      (I chose to ignore this).
      <br><br>
      In the code, the most interesting challenge for me was cropping the
      shape of the brackets according to the grid.
      I ended up writing a function that checks for collision over the span
      between the points of each bracket, pushing vertices into a polyshape as it goes.
      The other major challenge was fiddling with the rotation parameters of each set of brackets
      to get closer to the specific shapes in the work.
      There are so many possibile arrangements of this pattern it was difficult to narrow down
      an image that had a real resemblance to the original.
