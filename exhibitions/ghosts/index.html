		<h2>Ghosts</h2>
		<h3>MFA Thesis Exhibition - Emily Carr University</h3>
		<h3>March 2016 - Concourse Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>
		<p>
		Serving as a supporting exhibition for my MFA thesis defence, Ghosts featured a series of 9 half sheets of plywood hung around 
		the perimeter of an exhibition space in Emily Carr University's Granville Island campus. Three rectangular holes were cut in each 
		panel and a bright yellow plywood table supporting a series of cast plaster bottles was positioned in the center of the gallery.
		<br><br>This exhibition explored the ways in which we desire to derive meaning from even the most basic of forms. The rectangular 
		holes in each painting become contorted ghostly faces and the arrangement of bottles appear as chess pieces or figures from another 
		game of territorial strategy. Through reducing the complexity of form in this exhibition, I was interested in 
		reflecting on the content that each individual brings to the viewing of an artwork and how this highly subjective perception of
 		meaning follows us in our day to day lives.
