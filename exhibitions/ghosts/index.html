		<h2>Ghosts</h2>
		<h3>MFA Thesis Exhibition - Emily Carr University</h3>
		<h3>March 2016 - Concourse Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>
		<p>
		<i>Ghosts</i> featured a series of nine white monochrome paintings hung in the Concourse Gallery at Emily Carr University's Granville Island campus. 
		Three rectangular holes were cut in each 48"x48" plywood panel, which were mounted on to the walls prior to being 
		painted with the gallery's standard wall paint. A yellow plywood tabletop was positioned in the center of the space, supporting an array of contorted plaster cast 
		bottles.
		<br><br>
		As an exhibition <i>Ghosts</i> was designed to explore how we seek to derive meaning from form. The compositional 
		simplicity of the plywood paintings and procedural clarity of the plaster bottles leave room for a range of 
		interpretations. In this way, the title <i>Ghosts</i> refers to the figments of imagination that are triggered from 
		experiences of absence in our information saturated world. Through reducing complexity of form, this exhibition 
		invites individuals to reflect upon what they bring to the viewing of an artwork and how this subjective perception 
		follows them in everyday experiences.
