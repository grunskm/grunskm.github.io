		<h2>Ghosts</h2>
		<h3>MFA Thesis Exhibition - Emily Carr University</h3>
		<h3>March 2016 - Concourse Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>
		<p><br>
		<i>Ghosts</i> featured nine white monochrome paintings and a series of plastic water bottles cast in plaster. 
		<br>Three rectangular holes are cut from each plywood panel, which are mounted to the walls and
		painted with the gallery's standard wall paint. A yellow plywood tabletop supports the contorted plaster casts in the center of the space.
		<br><br>
<!-- 
		As an exhibition <i>Ghosts</i> was designed to explore how we seek to derive meaning from form. The compositional 
		simplicity of the plywood paintings and procedural clarity of the plaster bottles leave room for a range of 
		interpretations. In this way, the title <i>Ghosts</i> refers to the figments of imagination that are triggered from 
		experiences of absence in our information saturated world. Through reducing complexity of form, this exhibition 
		invites individuals to reflect upon what they bring to the viewing of an artwork and how this subjective perception 
		follows them in everyday experiences.
