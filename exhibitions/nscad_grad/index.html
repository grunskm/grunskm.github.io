		<h2>Matthis Grunsky - Paintings</h2><h3>BFA Graduation Exhibition - NSCAD University</h3>
		<h3>October 23-30, 2012, Gallery 1, Anna Leonowens Gallery, Halifax, NS</h3>
<p>
This solo exhibition of paintings occurred during the year of my graduation from NSCAD University. 
It featured paintings from the <a href="../../pages/sidewalks"><i>Sidewalk</i></a> 
series that depict patterns of chewing gum stuck on city sidewalks.</p> 

<p>These paintings feature the use of a glazing technique in which multiple sidewalk images are layered in sequence. A 
 tinted glaze is applied between each layer of dots, slowly obscuring earlier marks and generating a deep visual depth.
