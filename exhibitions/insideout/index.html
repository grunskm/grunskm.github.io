	<h2>Inside Out</h2>
	<h3>Collaborative Exhibition with <a href="http://mesparks.com/">M.E. Sparks</a><br>
		June 16-19, 2018 @<a href="http://www.sitefactory.ca/calendar/2018/6/16/me-sparks-matthis-grunsky-inside-out">SiteFactory</a><br>
		1600 Block Franklin St. Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>
<p>Looking at artist studios as a social and historical trope, Inside Out explored the nature of these spaces within the contemporary 
moment of increasingly dematerialized art practices and high rental costs in Vancouver. <br>
Hosted within the SiteFactory bus, the exhibition featured a set of found and constructed objects referencing historical depictions of the
artist's studio. A series of algorithmically animated drawings were projected on the white objects in an attempt to create a "living" painting 
within the space. Visitors to the exhibition were encouraged to enter into the projection and become part of the "painting".
