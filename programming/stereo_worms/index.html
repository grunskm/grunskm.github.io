		This artwork can be viewed using the cross-eyed method of stereoscopic free-viewing described below:<br><br>
		Keeping the screen at arms length, allow your eyes to relax until three white circles appear. 
		Train your attention on the middle circle while your eyes refocus. <br><br>
		It may take a few minutes for your eyes to fully adjust.<br>
		You may find following a single worm helps speed this process.<br><br>
		It is important to keep the screen rotationally aligned with your eyes. 
		If viewing on a laptop, try slowly rotating the computer from side to side. 
		The image should "snap" together when properly aligned with the eyes. <br><br>
		Viewed successfully, the image should be as clear as normal sight.
		The experience can be refined by placing a piece of paper with a circular opening halfway between the screen and the eyes so that the left circle is only visible from the right eye and the right circle is only visible from the left eye.
