		<h2>Flipbooks<br>
		</h2>
		<p>
		Inspired by the post COVID surge of interest in looping GIF animations, 
		I've made a series of flipbooks exploring the possibilities of line, gesture, and colour.
		Measuring 2x4x1/2in and 60 pages thick, 
		each flipbook depicts two colourful filaments meandering through a three dimensional space. 
		When flipped, the animation reveals an orbiting motion in which the filaments rotate around themselves, 
		finishing exactly where they started in a perfect loop.
		</p><p>
		These flipbooks relate to my larger project of exploring the relationship between 
		humans and computers through processes of mechanical drawing. 
		While the forms that the computer draws may appear similar to those of human artists,
		the precision with which the computer manipulates the form betrays the immense speed 
		of computational process; something that is eminently non-human.
		</p>
		In the current environment of AI chatbots and virtual home assistants, I feel that it is important to remain
		cognisant of the computer's true, inhuman quality.
