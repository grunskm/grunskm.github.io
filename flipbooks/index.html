		<h2>Flipbooks<br>
		</h2>
		<p>
		Inspired by the post COVID surge of interest in looping GIF animations, 
		this series of flipbooks explore a motif of line, colour, and movement.
		Measuring 2x4x1/2in and 60 pages thick, each flipbook depicts two colourful filaments 
		meandering through a three dimensional space. 
		When flipped, the animation reveals a rotating motion in which the filaments orbit around themselves, 
		finishing exactly where they started in a perfect loop.
		</p><p>
		These flipbooks relate to my larger project of exploring the relationship between 
		humans and computers through processes of mechanical drawing. 
		While figures drawn by the computer may appear similar to those of human artists,
		the precision with which the computer manipulates these forms betrays the cold mechanization  
		of computational process; something that is eminently non-human.
		</p>
		In the current environment of AI chatbots and virtual home assistants, I feel that it is important to remain
		aware of the computer's true, inhuman quality.
