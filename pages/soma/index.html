		<h2>Selected Compositions</h2>
		<h3>June 15-23, 2019 <br> South Main Gallery, Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>	
	
	<p> <i>Selected Compositions</i> was a solo exhibition featuring <a href=""> sidewalk paintings</a> and <a href="">plaster drawings</a> that use 
computational processes to explore composition, colour, and pattern. <br>

Questioning my role in the creative production of my own work, I have developed a computer program to generate the content 
of my paintings. Contrary to certain practices of conceptual art, however, I am not as interested in the language surrounding 
artistic production, as I am in aspects of aesthetic decision making that are (sometimes romantically) associated with painting. </p><p>
I am especially interested in how our experience of colour can be liberated from the grasp of language though abstraction. Everyday language 
is woefully unequipped for meaningful discussion of colour, and symbolic or representational language is too often used when specificity is 
needed; perverting the perception of colour with names like ‘Dusky Dawn’, ‘Blueberry Popover’, or ‘Twig Basket.’  Even in the context of painting, 
where accurate description of colour is paramount, the language available is riddled with vestigial meanings, recalling medieval histories, 
 mineral ores, and alchemic processes. These associations, albeit  fascinating, alter how colour is understood and limit freedoms in 
both expression and perception. </p><p>
The main body of work featured in <b>Selected Compositions</b> is a family of <a href=""> sidewalk paintings</a> which I have been developing since 2010. 
Early paintings in this series are reproductions of patterns of gum stuck on blocks of city sidewalk. Using found composition in this way allows me to 
fragment the creative process and isolate specific moments of aesthetic decision making. The dotted patterns appear to me as indexes of form; creating 
constellations of meaning in a connect-the-dot-like manner.  </p><p>
Moving away from actual sidewalks, the paintings in this exhibition depict images generated by purpose written computer programs. The computer 
uses random numbers to create an endless stream of images from which I select compositions. In this way, the selection of form and colour is 
distanced from established systems of compositional structure or colour theory, and more closely resembles the chance encounters that 
inspired the original paintings in this series. <b>Selected Compositions</b> promotes the questioning of conventional ideas around compositional 
structure and colour theory in favour of a more intuitive, experience based approach to aesthetic decision making.
