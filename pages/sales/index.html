		<p>As of January 2020 I will no longer accept money in exchange for my artwork. <br><br>
The primary reason for this is because I would like my work to be accessible to anyone who wants it. 
Even at its cheapest, purchasing art is unaffordable for most people, including myself. 
To me this is unconscionable. I would rather make zero profit from my work, than know that it is only accessible to those with money.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in obtaining an artwork that you see on this website, please send me a message specifying which piece you would like. Provided the work is available, you may have it for the cost of shipping. 
<br><br>I do accept monetary and material contributions from those who wish to support my studio rent and material costs. <br><br>
