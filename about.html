        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>
          Matthis Grunsky is an artist and educator whose work moves between
          painting, drawing, publishing, and browser-based artworks. His
          practice treats images as living systems, using mark, pattern, and
          repetition to build visual spaces that feel both handmade and
          computational.

          Across studio work and digital projects, Grunsky explores perception
          by translating drawing into a perceptual event rather than a static
          image. The work often asks for slow, embodied looking: forms drift
          between notation and organism, and simple procedural systems become
          spatial, time-based experiences. Stereoscopic viewing activates the
          viewer as a participant, making perception itself part of the work
          while also signaling the iterative logic of computational systems.
